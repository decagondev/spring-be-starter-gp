# Frontend Readme

## Phase 1
You have been provided with some initial `HTML` boilerplate markup. Your task is to read over the `HTML` tags and take a look at [W3Schools Reference Material](http://w3schools.com/) to see what sort of tags you have available and are in use. In particular, pay attention to the `img` tag reference and the concept of what a tag really is. **[Concept of a HTML Tag](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-an-html-tag)**.

Once you are comfortable with the idea of what an `HTML` tag is and what `img` tags are in general, take a look in the `index.html` file for comments to see where you need to add markup. The instructions will be marked using comments in the html file. Comments are marked in `HTML` with a starting tag `<!--` and a closing tag `-->`.

Then you can move on to the `contact.html` file and follow the instructions in that file to add markup needed to complete `Phase 1`.



Once all of the tasks are completed from Phase 1 you can then move on to Phase 2 below.
