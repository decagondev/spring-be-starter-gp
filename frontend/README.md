# Frontend Readme

## Phase 1
You have been provided with some initial `HTML` boilerplate markup. Your task is to read over the `HTML` tags and take a look at [W3Schools Reference Material](http://w3schools.com/) to see what sort of tags you have available and are in use. In particular, pay attention to the `img` tag reference and the concept of what a tag really is. **[Concept of a HTML Tag](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-an-html-tag)**.

Once you are comfortable with the idea of what an `HTML` tag is and what `img` tags are in general, take a look in the `index.html` file for comments to see where you need to add markup. The instructions will be marked using comments in the html file. Comments are marked in `HTML` with a starting tag `<!--` and a closing tag `-->`.

Then you can move on to the `contact.html` file and follow the instructions in that file to add markup needed to complete `Phase 1`.

**Once all of the tasks are completed from Phase 1 you can then move on to Phase 2 below.**

## Phase 2 - CSS and Styles
Have you got this far? Well done! You are getting in to the fun stuff: *styles*. Well, your task now is to read over the `index.css` and `contact.css` files and complete the tasks in the file's comments.

**Phase 2 is complete when you have filled in the styles requested in the `css files comments`.**

**Once all of the tasks are completed from Phase 2 you can then move on to Phase 3 below.**

## Phase 3 - JavaScript Ahoy!
In this phase you have been tasked with updating the `index.js` and `contact.js` files. Read the comments in each respective file to find out what you need to do. Only concern yourself with comments marked with `Phase 3`. **Ignore the `Phase 4` comments at this point.**

**Phase 3 is complete when you have followed the `Phase 3` comments in the `js` files, and your front end is pulling data from the `staticContacts` array**

**Once all of the tasks are completed from Phase 3 you can then move on to Phase 4 below.**

## Phase 4 - Lets GET some `CR` in our Axios
OK, so now that you are a JavaScript officianado, it is time to flex your JS muscles and use a module. The Axios module to be precise. You are now tasked with moving away from the confines of our `staticContacts` array, and will be refactoring the `index.js` and `contact.js` code to allow us to perform `POST` and `GET` operations by way of the `Axios` module. For this phase, you will need to follow the respective comments marked `Phase 4` in the JS files.

**Phase 4 is complete when you have refactored the front end to pull data from the back end api using Axios**

**Once all of the tasks are completed from Phase 4 you can then move on to The Phase 5 `Strech Goals` in the main `README.md` file.**
